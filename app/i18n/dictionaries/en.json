      "p2": "We've worked with ESP32, RP2040, and STM32 platforms, across CAN, USB, and Wi-Fi projects, with a strong focus on power and thermal constraints. Our approach is practical and detail-oriented: clean schematics, layouts that are easy to manufacture, and software that behaves reliably outside the lab."
