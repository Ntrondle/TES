## Step 2: Safety Precautions

<warning type="warning">
Before you begin, please review these important safety guidelines.
</warning>

### Soldering Safety

Soldering irons are dangerous tools. To avoid injury or accidents:

- Never touch the heated tip of the soldering iron
- Always place the iron on a heat-resistant surface or proper stand
- Never leave the soldering iron unattended while powered on
- Turn off and unplug the iron when not in use
- Work in a well-ventilated area

### Handling Your MicroFlip

**Fragile construction:** MicroFlip V1 is a delicate PCB. When not seated inside a housing (such as the Goose Belt Purge enclosure), avoid applying force to the board. It is only supported by the motor leads. A future revision will address this limitation.

**SMD components:** The surface-mount device (SMD) components on this board can be dislodged if handled incorrectly. To prevent damage:

- Do not pry at components with your fingernails
- Do not apply excessive force to the rocking slider

**Shipping damage:** Some pre-soldered MicroFlip units have arrived with solder joints damaged during shipping. If you're affected, you can safely re-solder the PCB connections to the motor.
