# MicroFlip

*Ultra‑compact polarity‑reverser board for N20‑size brushed DC gear‑motors*

## Overview

**MicroFlip** is a thumb‑sized breakout that lets you drive a 3–12 V N20 gear‑motor in either direction with a single slide. A rugged DPDT switch wired in an H‑pattern swaps both motor leads, while an on‑board 0 .1 µF / 120 Ω RC snubber suppresses brush noise and protects the contacts from arcing.

Drop MicroFlip between your motor and your motherboard, and enjoy instant bidirectional control—no microcontroller, no firmware, just **flip to drive, flip back to rewind**.

## Features

* **True DPDT reversal** – slide switch swaps *both* motor leads for reliable forward ↔ reverse operation.
* **Compact footprint** – fits inside most micro‑robot and lock‑actuator housings.
* **Up to 1 A stall current** – short traces keep resistive losses low.
* **Integrated RC snubber** – 0 .1 µF X7R + 120 Ω ½ W series network mounted right at the motor pins.
* **Flexible I/O** – large, castellated pads accept 22–26 AWG silicone leads or 2‑pin JST‑PH connectors.

> **Maximum ratings**: 12 V nominal, 1 A peak. For higher currents use a MOSFET H‑bridge instead.
